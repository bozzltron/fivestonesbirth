    <p>
      My goal is to help you find balance during the ever changing seasons of life. I believe there is a strong connection between mind, body and soul. 
      I have found relieving muscle tension can release emotional stressors. Clearing chakras can make room for intuitive thoughts. 
      They are integrated together and self care is vital to all aspects of health. I began my professional work as a massage therapist in 
      2007 after graduating from Omaha School of Massage. Prior to that, I spent 10 years in the mental health field with a focus in psychology and social work. 
      I follow my passions to see where they lead and find ways to incorporate the knowledge and skills into my services as I go. 
      I love learning and getting new certifications is one of my favorite past times. I became a Reiki Master in 2008, a certified birth doula in 2009, 
      a childbirth educator in 2011, a placenta encapsulation specialist in 2013, finished my mindfulness and meditation certification and became 
      a traditional herbalist in 2018 and then in 2019 I completed my 100 hour yoga teacher training and taught yoga Nidra.

    <p>I have such gratitude for the 
      path that has led me to this beautiful stage in life with my spouse, 3 daughters and ever growing animal crew. I am an active member in a local 
      running group and enjoy hiking big mountains and training for long races- anything that gives me extended time to enjoy nature.

    <h3>Reiki</h3>

    <p>
      Uses charged crystals, stones and/or singing bowls and aromatherapy to
      clear and balance the chakras. Two options: You can add this energy work
      into any massage session to take it to the next level or add a dedicated
      30 minutes on to the end of any session to extend your healing time. Reiki
      is a form of therapy that can use hands-on, no touch or visualization
      techniques, with the goal of improving the flow of chi, life energy, in a
      person. Reiki (pronounced ray-key), means “universal life energy” in
      Japanese, and Reiki practitioners are trained to detect and alleviate
      problems of energy flow in the physical, emotional and spiritual level.

    <h3>Cupping</h3>

    <p>
      Cupping has been practiced in various cultures for more than 3,000 years.
      It uses cups and suction to create negative air pressure next to the skin,
      in effect “lifting” the skin from the soft tissues underneath and allowing
      fluid to more freely nourish those tissues. This helps the deeper tissues
      move stagnation out and bring oxygen rich blood in. This add on service
      would be for cupping of one area incorporated into your massage session.
      Cupping for more than one area or blanket cupping are available for an
      additional charge.
    </p>

    <h3>Hydrating hand and foot treatment</h3>
    <p>
      This ultra-thick blend of organic shea butter and coconut oil are combined
      with heat therapy to leave your skin soft and hydrated.
    </p>

    <h3>Exfoliating foot treatment</h3>
    <p>
      Using an organic sugar scrub designed by yours truly, this will help
      slough off any flakiness and add moisture, ending with hot towel wraps to
      seal in the pores and clean off the scrub. You can also combine this with
      the hydrating hand and foot treatment to level up to pedicure soft
      tootsies.
    </p>
    <h3>Aromatherapy facial steam</h3>

    <p>
      First a moisturizing organic facial cream is applied followed by a nice
      steamy, aromatherapy towel. The heat helps open your pores to better
      absorb while the scent simultaneously melts the stress of the day away and
      brings you into the present. Repeat another round of cream in those
      thirsty pores and end with a face massage for the ultimate post massage
      glow.
    </p>

    <h3>Custom Aromatherapy option</h3>

    <p>
      I will work with you to custom blend an aromatherapy oil for use during
      your session. Then you get to take the glass pump bottle home with the
      remaining 4ish ounces to use at your leisure any time you want to that
      lovely scent to bring you back to the same relaxed state of mind.
    </p>

    <h2>Massage Offerings</h2>

    <p>
      Enjoy some rest and relaxation while expecting as I help you find ease in
      your ever changing body. With pregnancy specific moves to target the hips
      and sacrum, the hip release work can help baby find optimal fetal
      positioning which can alleviate some discomforts and set you up for an
      easier birth. Massage is offered with prenatal props so you can enjoy some
      time lying face down while baby is comfortably and safely supported or the
      side lying position can be utilized with support from all the pillows.
      Just select the Custom Therapeutic Massage option and be sure to include
      your guess date on the questionaire to alert me so I can be prepared to
      accommodate this exciting time of growth.
    </p>

    <h3>Ease Your Heart Out</h3>
    <p>
      We start with an aromatherapy facial steam to wash the stress of the day
      off and bring your full attention to your healing. Each session can be
      customized to your needs or you can keep your intention to yourself and
      let us follow your body's cues. I will work on areas of vulnerability that
      tend to hold onto trauma and pain. This can include working trigger points
      in your neck, pecs, upper back and shoulders. All the muscles that help
      you lift your chin and ease your heart out to the world. Typically
      abdominal work is done on the digestive tract to calm nervous tummies and
      a diaphragm release to allow you breathe even deeper, releasing old energy
      and bringing in cleansing breath cycles. A psoas releases will help you
      take steps forward, leaving the past behind if you have felt stuck. This
      is coupled with chakra clearing and balancing and calming energy work and
      the use of charged stones. My goal is to help you clear your busy mind,
      intuitively find your path to healing, and ease your heart back into the
      world. I want to gently hold space for you as you seek answers inward. *A
      60 minute session will take place face up on the table. If you want more
      bodywork on the posterior muscles as well, book the 90 minute option.
    </p>

    <h3>Fertility Enhancing Massage</h3>
    <p>
      Fertility Enhancing Massage can be used in a natural or medically assisted
      cycle. Booking should take place prior to ovulation and at a time you know
      you are not pregnant. By communicating with your therapist, a custom
      massage is tailored to your unique needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reproductive system, which is a secondary system, is aided by helping
      to balance the following primary systems- respiratory, digestive,
      circulatory, lymphatic, nervous, endocrine, and muscular. Your treatment
      session could include castor oil packs, breathing exercises, essential
      oils, comfortably rerouting blood flow from the femoral artery into the

      lining, abdominal work to reduce scar tissue, adhesions and help break
      down cysts and improve digestion, reflexology to stimulate hormone
      production, lymph drainage to aid in detoxing, energy work focused on

    <h3>Fertility Enhancing Massage Testimonials</h3>

    <blockquote>
      I highly recommend Dusti for all types of massage. Although I will never
      forget the fertility massages that she gave me. My husband I had some
      troubles getting pregnant for a while. With this being such a stressful
      situation she recommend this. The massage was so relaxing and really
      helped me find peace when I was there and hope for the future when I left.
      She is incredible!

      I had the pleasure of getting fertility massages from Dusti Bosworth
      during my almost 2 year time of trying to conceive. Not only is she such a
      tender and compassionate massage therapist, but she really puts dedication
      into helping you achieve your goals. I've also received maternity massages
      and deep tissue massages from Dusti, and every time I leave her table I
      feel like she has given me exactly what I needed her to. I am currently 6
      months pregnant, and I believe Dusti's massages have played a huge factor
      in that, and I would recommend her to anyone.

      I am a 29 year old PCOS suffer! I never knew I had PCOS until I tried
      getting pregnant with my first baby. I had to start taking fertility drugs
      and making appointments for ultrasounds. Finally six months later I was
      pregnant and had a healthy baby girl! Fast forward two years and here we
      were again trying to get pregnant. We knew already what we were dealing
      with this time so we were hopeful that in about six months we would be
      pregnant again. Next thing I knew we were at a year already! I knew we
      needed to change what we were doing! This is where the wonderful Dusti
      came in! I had seen her many times for regular massages! Then a friend of
      mine told me to talk to her about fertility massage! My next appointment
      with her we tried one! I was so relaxed when I left!! The next month I was
      taking clomid and I did another massage. Just having her presence and her
      positive attitude helped my attitude change so much!! I left feeling
      positive and very optimistic!! I had my ultrasound on day 14 and I had a
      dominant follicle!!! We didn't get pregnant so we went back for a 3rd
      month! Another dominant follicle this month!! We had to go back for month
      4, this time no follicle! By this point I was so sick of the doctors
      appointments! The only thing that was making me feel good were the monthly
      massages I was getting!! We were at a year and 5 months of trying! I told
      my husband that I was done with the doctor for a month!! I wanted to just
      go see Dusti and her magical hands! She just felt so healing to me and
      that is what I needed for a month!! Six weeks later I had my first
      ultrasound! There was a heartbeat!! We were so excited! Dusti definitely
      helped get us pregnant!! I honestly believe that we wouldn't have gotten
      pregnant without her! She is the most positive person I know and she just
      has such a healing vibe that comes off of her! She wants to help you more
      than you know! She takes these massages so personal! I continued to see
      her throughout my pregnancy. By the end of my pregnancy I was visiting her
      every other week!!
